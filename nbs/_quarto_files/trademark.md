# Trademark Policy

This policy is adapted directly from the WordPress Foundation’s
[trademark policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/)
for the WordPress and WordCamp names and logos. We admire the job that
WordPress has done building a thriving open source community while at
the same time making possible a wide variety of WordPress related
businesses. We hope that this policy will help us do the same for
Quarto.

## Goals

[Posit, PBC](https://www.posit.co/about/) owns and oversees the
trademark for the Quarto name and logo. We have developed this trademark
usage policy with the following goals in mind:

1.  We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the Quarto name or logo
    for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve Quarto.

2.  We’d like to make it clear how Quarto-related businesses and
    projects can (and cannot) use the Quarto name and logo.

3.  We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the Quarto name and logo
    to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for
    official Quarto resources.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit open source
or commercial activity around Quarto. We actively encourage Quarto-based
open source projects and businesses—our goal with this policy is to
prevent confusion about the source of Quarto related software and
services.

## Permission

Permission from Posit is required to use the Quarto name or logo as part
of any project, product, service, domain name, or company name.

We will grant permission to use the Quarto name and logo for projects
that meet the following criteria:

-   The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and
    improvement of the Quarto software.

-   Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover
    its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run
    as a for-profit project or business).

-   Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that
    currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which Quarto is
    distributed.

If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the
Quarto name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with
these exceptions: (1) Please do not use Quarto as part of a domain name;
and (2) We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising,
including AdSense/AdWords.

All other Quarto-related businesses or projects can use the Quarto name
and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use
them as part of a product, project, service, domain name, or company
name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation
with or endorsement by the Quarto open source project.

The abbreviation “QMD” is not covered by the Quarto trademark and you
are free to use it in any way you see fit.

## Examples

A consulting company can describe its business as “123 Publishing
Services, offering Quarto consulting for publishers,” but cannot call
its business “The Quarto Consulting Company.” Similarly, a business
related to Quarto extensions can describe itself as “XYZ Extensions, the
world’s best Quarto extensions,” but cannot call itself “The Quarto
Extension Portal.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the Quarto logo as part of a page that
describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part
of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no
circumstances is it permitted to use Quarto as part of a domain name or
top-level domain name.

When in doubt about your use of the Quarto name or logo, please contact
Posit at <permissions@rstudio.com> for clarification.
