## Keynote

[**Reimagine + Collaborate + Share with
Quarto**](https://sched.co/11iZo) **(Keynote)**: [(Talk
recording)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/keynotes/collaborate-with-quarto/)

-   Presented by [Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/)
    (Director, Openscapes) and [Mine
    Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://mine-cr.com/) (Developer Educator at
    RStudio and Professor at Duke University).
-   Thursday July 28, 9:00am - 10:00am EDT.
-   What is Quarto? In this talk, in four acts, we will discuss how
    Quarto unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. Through our
    work with NASA Openscapes, Duke University, and RStudio, we will
    share our experiences authoring, teaching, and collaborating with
    Quarto. Full of demos with Quarto in RStudio and Jupyter and weaving
    together narrative, R, and Python code, we will showcase features of
    Quarto that have enabled us to reimagine our reproducible workflows.
    This talk will help you get the most out of Quarto regardless of
    your background with R Markdown, the computing language(s) you use,
    and your tool of choice for authoring.

## Workshops

We will have two Quarto workshops at the conference, held on July 25-26,
one for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown and
the other for those who want to take their R Markdown skills and
expertise and apply them in Quarto.

-   [**Getting Started with
    Quarto**](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/get-started-quarto/)**:**
    This workshop is designed for those who have no or little prior
    experience with R Markdown. In this 2 day workshop you will learn
    about the Quarto format for technical communication and computation.
    The workshop will teach you how to get started creating and fully
    customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of
    RStudio’s Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing
    all of Pandoc markdown. The workshop will also provide an overview
    of Quarto’s developer tooling support in alternative tools such as
    Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors. The workshop will briefly
    cover how to add interactivity to Quarto with Shiny, Observable JS,
    htmlwidgets or Jupyter Widgets. Lastly, the workshop will cover
    Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites
    or entire books. Presented by [Tom
    Mock](https://themockup.blog/about.html), Customer Enablement Lead
    at RStudio, this workshop will be appropriate for attendees who
    answer yes to these questions:

    -   Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your
        code, documentation, and outputs in a cohesive “data product”?
    -   Do you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for
        data science?
    -   Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing
        technical or scientific documents with literate programming?

    [https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/get-started-quarto/](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/get-started-quarto).

-   [**From R Markdown to
    Quarto**](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/workshops/rmd-to-quarto)**:**
    This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R
    Markdown skills and expertise and apply them in Quarto. In this
    workshop you will learn how to apply your reproducible authoring
    skills to the Quarto format and learn about new tools and workflows
    for authoring with Quarto in RStudio. You will learn to create
    static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and
    htmlwidgets, and to create presentations in various formats such as
    reveal.js, beamer, and pptx. The workshop will also introduce you to
    Quarto projects which you can use to build websites and write blogs
    and books. Finally, you will learn various ways to deploy and
    publish your Quarto projects on the web. Independent modules will
    also highlight authoring in Quarto with Jupyter and VS Code as well
    as other text editors. Presented by [Andrew
    Bray](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/andrew-bray), Associate
    Teaching Professor in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley,
    this workshop will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to any
    of these questions:

    -   Have you authored R Markdown documents and are you interested in
        migrating your workflow to its successor format, Quarto?
    -   Are you interested in exploring the wide spectrum of documents
        that can be produced with Quarto, including static documents,
        websites, and slides?

## Talks

-   [**Quarto for R Markdown users**](https://sched.co/11iZa): [(Talk
    recording)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/quarto-for-rmarkdown-users/)
    -   Presented by [Tom Mock](https://themockup.blog/about.html),
        Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio.
    -   Wednesday July 27, 3:20pm - 3:40pm EDT.
    -   Are you curious about Quarto? Maybe you saw it on Twitter or the
        RStudio::conf agenda. Perhaps this raised questions like: What
        exactly is Quarto? What about RMarkdown? (don’t worry it’s not
        going away!) What features does Quarto add? What should I do
        with my existing Rmd/ipynb files? This talk will answer all of
        those questions and more! I’ll present Quarto as a next-gen
        version of RMarkdown, compare the similarities, and then discuss
        the new features in Quarto for publishing documents,
        presentations, blog posts, lab notebooks and more! Lastly, I’ll
        cover what this means for our customers using RStudio Team, and
        the exciting new world for Python users.
-   [**These are a few of my favorite things (about Quarto
    presentations)**](https://sched.co/11ibN): [(Talk
    recording)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/my-favorite-things-quarto-presentations/)
    -   Presented by [Tracy Teal](https://twitter.com/tracykteal), Open
        Source Program Director at RStudio.
    -   Thursday July 28, 2022 3:20pm - 3:40pm EDT.
    -   Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown, and comes with a new
        presentation format, revealjs. In this talk, I’ll show a few of
        my favorite things about making interactive HTML presentations
        with Quarto. Along the way you’ll learn about the visual editor,
        multiple columns, delivering an effective talk with speaker
        notes and mode, making your presentations pop with transitions,
        effective ways to incorporate code into your presentation,
        beautiful themes (and how to match your corporate style guide),
        and sharing it as pdf and HTML. I’ll finish off with a brief
        look at generating a PowerPoint presentation from a template.
-   [**Literate Programming With Jupyter Notebooks and
    Quarto**](https://sched.co/11ibe): [(Talk
    recording)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/literate-programming-quarto/)
    -   Presented by [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev/), head of Data
        Science at [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com/) (the
        developers of [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/)) and core
        developer at [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/).
    -   Thursday July 28, 3:40pm - 4:00pm EDT.
    -   Jupyter Notebooks play a critical role in in the workflow of
        many users. Notebooks are used to document existing code, to
        quickly prototype and iterate on ideas, and as a medium of
        technical communication. However, package developers typically
        use an entirely separate set of more traditional development
        tools, and the context switching between these tools and
        notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability
        to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test
        your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and
        tests separately from source code. Nbdev is a literate
        programming framework that allows you to develop Python
        libraries within Jupyter Notebooks. This talk will describe the
        integration between Nbdev and Quarto, which enables library
        developers to author their documentation right alongside their
        code, and automatically produce a Quarto website for their
        package. The result is a seamless workflow for developing,
        documenting, and testing software packages all within Jupyter
        Notebooks, with no context-switching required.
-   [**Websites & Books & Blogs, oh my! Creating Rich Content with
    Quarto**](https://sched.co/11ibV): [(Talk
    recording)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/sessions/quarto-deep-dive/websites-books-blogs-quarto/)
    -   Presented by [Devin Pastoor](https://github.com/dpastoor),
        Solutions Engineer at RStudio.
    -   Thursday July 28, 4:00pm - 4:20pm EDT.
    -   A number of packages have emerged in the R ecosystem to help
        create websites (hugodown), books (bookdown), and blogs
        (blogdown). In this talk, I’ll show you how Quarto handles
        creating these types of content and more. Whether you’re a grad
        student considering your first blog post about R, or a python
        expert about to write a technical book, I’ll show you how Quarto
        enables you to focus on content while it takes care of the rest.
        In addition, I’ll show the RStudio team is making it as easy as
        possible to publish and share content within your organization
        and to the whole community.
