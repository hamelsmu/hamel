If you are an R Markdown user wondering about the relationship between
Quarto and R Markdown, see also our [FAQ for R Markdown
Users](../../docs/faq/rmarkdown.html).

### What can I use Quarto for?

Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to
produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts,
books and more.   

### How do I install Quarto?

Visit the Quarto.org [Get Started
page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which provides installation
instructions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.   

### Is Quarto free to use?

Yes! Quarto is [open source](https://quarto.org/license.html) with a
GPL-2 license. You can use or disseminate it any way that you would any
[GPL-2 licensed open source
software](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html). 

### What output formats can Quarto create?

There are many output formats available in Quarto. This includes all of
the built in Pandoc formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word, Revealjs, ePub,
etc.) as well as various ways to publish multiple documents (websites,
blogs, and books). Learn more at [Quarto
Formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html). 

### What editing tools can I use with Quarto?

You can use a wide variety of tools with Quarto. We have provided
documentation for writing and editing Quarto documents in VSCode,
JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, or any text editor. Visit the [Get Started with
Quarto page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to install, and then
choose your tool for a brief introductory guide.

### Can I use Jupyter notebooks with Quarto?

Yes! Quarto can [render Jupyter
notebooks](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html) and you can
use Jupyter, JupyterLab or any other .ipynb notebook editor with Quarto.
You can render existing .ipynb notebooks as-is with Quarto, but adding
Quarto-specific output options or a YAML header can enhance the output.
Visit the[JupyterLab
page](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html) for more
information.

### What programming languages are supported in Quarto?

The principal languages supported by Quarto are Python, R, Julia, and
Observable JavaScript. Integration with Jupyter also enables the use of
many other languages. 

Each Quarto document can be optionally processed by a computational
engine (the engine can be manually specified or automatically detected
based on the code chunks within). Current engines include Knitr (which
is also used by R Markdown and supports [a variety of
languages](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/other-languages.html)
including R, Python, and Julia, etc.) and Jupyter (which supports many
languages including Python, Julia, and R). See the documentation on
[Engine
Binding](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#engine-binding)
for additional details.

### What human languages are supported in Quarto?

You can write your Quarto documentation in your human language of
choice. The [lang](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#language-variables)
[document
option](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/language.html#lang-option) is
used to identify the main language of the document using IETF language
tags (following the [BCP 47
standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)), such as en or en-GB. 

### Can I use Quarto to develop proprietary content?

Yes! The copyright on Quarto does not cover the original content that
you generate using Quarto. Using Quarto to create original content does
not place any restrictions, legally, on the license that you choose for
the original content that you create, nor does it “reach through” to
affect software that you might be writing documentation for with Quarto.

### But doesn’t the GPL cover exported HTML documents when they include styles or functionalities from Quarto?

It covers the styles or functionalities themselves. It does not cover
your original content because your original content is not a derivative
work of the Quarto styles or functionalities.

### How can I share documents and have people comment on them?

You can publish Quarto content to various locations. See the user guides
for [publishing](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) for details on
using Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Posit Connect, and other
services with Quarto. Once documents are published you can use 
[hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/),
[Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), or [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for
commenting. Learn more in the documentation on
[commenting](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting).

### Can I do collaborative editing with Quarto?

There is not yet anything specific for collaborative editing in Quarto.
You can collaborate on .qmd files in the same way you currently do for
any text or code files. 

Posit Workbench allows for [Project
Sharing](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/211659737-Sharing-Projects-in-RStudio-Workbench-RStudio-Server-Pro)
for interactive editing and collaboration on the same document.

### Where can I publish Quarto websites?

There are a wide variety of ways to publish Quarto websites. Website
content is by default written to the `\_site` sub-directory (you can
customize this using the output-dir option). Publishing is simply a
matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting
service.

The [publishing
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/other.html) describes
several convenient options for Quarto website deployment including Posit
Connect, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase, Site44, and Amazon S3. We’ll
mostly defer to the documentation provided by those various services,
but will note any Quarto website specific configuration required.

### Does Posit Connect support Quarto?

Yes! You can publish Quarto content to Posit Connect v2021.08.0 or
later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the Posit Connect
[admin
guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#Quarto).
Connect’s user
[documentation](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/quarto/) refers to
[Quarto.org
docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html#rstudio-connect)
on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto
content, you can use the [rsconnect-python
CLI](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsconnect-python/) from various locations,
including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal.

### Who are the developers of Quarto?

Development of Quarto is sponsored by [Posit,
PBC](https://www.posit.co/). The same core team works on both Quarto and
R Markdown:

-   Carlos Scheidegger ([@cscheid](https://github.com/cscheid))

-   Charles Teague ([@dragonstyle](https://github.com/dragonstyle))

-   Christophe Dervieux ([@cderv](https://github.com/cderv))

-   J.J. Allaire ([@jjallaire](https://github.com/jjallaire/))

-   Yihui Xie ([@yihui](https://github.com/yihui))

Here is the [full contributors
list](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/graphs/contributors).
Quarto is open source and we welcome contributions in our github
repository as well! <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli>.

### Why the name Quarto?

We wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing
and landed on Quarto, which is the format of a book or pamphlet produced
from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then
folded twice to produce four leaves. The earliest known European printed
book is a Quarto, the
[Sibyllenbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyllenbuch_fragment),
believed to have been printed by [Johannes
Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) in 1452–53.

### Where can I report bugs or request features?

Thanks for finding something and sharing with us! You can file an issue
in the Quarto repository
<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues>.

### Where can I ask questions and discuss using Quarto with others?

The best place to ask questions and see what questions other people have
is in Quarto discussions
(<https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions>).
