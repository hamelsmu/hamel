    In this presentation, Antoine Chaffin explains the inherent limitations of single-vector search, such as information loss from pooling and poor out-of-domain performance, and introduces late interaction (multi-vector) models as a superior solution. He demonstrates how these models excel in long-context and reasoning-intensive tasks and presents the PyLate library to make training and evaluating these powerful models more accessible.

    [00:00:00] Hello everyone, my name is Chapan and I
    [00:00:02] am a research engineer at Leighton and
    [00:00:05] today I will detail some of the limits
    [00:00:08] of single vector search that have been
    [00:00:10] highlighted by recent usages and
    [00:00:13] evaluations and then I will introduce
    [00:00:16] multi vector models also known as late
    [00:00:18] interaction models and how they can
    [00:00:21] overcome this and to finish I will
    [00:00:24] briefly present the pilot library that
    [00:00:26] al
